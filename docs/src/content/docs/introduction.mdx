The rise of various JavaScript (or TypeScript) frameworks such as Next.js and Nuxt has brought
in various new concepts in the world of web programming. There is no doubt that these
frameworks shapes on how people write web code, and how they prefer to write it next. Things
like server actions, file based routing, having SSR and SSG in the same framework sure does
sound amazing. Why don't we do the same here, in Python? This is the problem that I wish to
tackle with this project.

Next, Python now starts to encourage type hints more than ever. That is, undoubtably, will
continue to be the case. So why not embrace it? Let's try to make our entire stack to be
more meaningful with types. Unfortunately, unlike JS world where they have JSX/TSX, we don't
have the equivalent of it (yet?). So, we're stuck with HTML templates files, that (in my
opinion), is quite cumbersome to use after coming back from these JS frameworks.

This is why I built Liku before, with the full motivation can be seen [here](https://rorre.github.io/liku/motivation/).
As you can see, I wish to bring more composability and Python integration when we are rendering
HTML. This project serves as a testing point for me on what can be improved to achieve the
same level of comfortability with these JS frameworks.

My end goal would have some sort of templating engine integrated like how JSX or [templ](https://github.com/a-h/templ) is. Let's see if I can achieve it one day!
