Let's get you started quickly by setting up a Likulau project!

## Requirements

- **Python 3.12+**. Older versions are and will not be supported
- IDE. Visual Studio Code with official Python extension works
- Terminal. You will need this to run the server

## Template

<Aside>
This section is WIP, there is no template to get started quickly yet. Please proceed with manual installation.

## Manual Setup

You will need to install Likulau first:

```bash
$ pip install git+https://github.com/rorre/likulau.git
```

### Your First Page

Likulau makes use of file-based routing. All your pages will be inside the `src/pages` directory.
Now, let's try to make a new file called `src/pages/index.py`:

```py
# src/pages/index.py
import liku as e

def page():
    return e.p(children="Hello world!")

```

Next, try to run the server now!

```bash
$ likulau dev
INFO:     Started server process [14884]
INFO:     Waiting for application startup.
INFO:     Application startup complete.
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```

Open your browser, and go to the link provided. It should show your hello world message!
