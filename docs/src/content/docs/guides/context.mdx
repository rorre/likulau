Often times, you need to pass a state or information to a child component. Usually, you do this by
leveraging props. However, imagine the case where you need to pass a state to a deeply nested
component, down in the DOM tree. You will need to pass the props from top all the way to the bottom,
this is what we call "prop drilling". See the image above for an example of prop drilling.

<Image src={propDrillImage} alt="App Component sending data through props to Great Grandchild Component 2" />

## Context

To solve this problem, Liku provides Context so all data can be consumed to all child components without
the need of sending it through props. It works much like dependency injection, once the parent has provided
the data to the context, all the child is able to receive the data by asking through the key.

<Image src={contextImage} alt="App Component sending data through context to Great Grandchild Component 2" />

Let's take a look at how we can make our context!

```py {"1. Create our context object":11-12} {"2. Provide the data to the context using with() statement":15-16} {"3. Use the use_context() hook to receive the data from the provider":24-25}
from dataclasses import dataclass
from liku.htm import html
from liku.context import Context, use_context

@dataclass
class User:
    name: str
    age: int
    role: str


UserContext = Context("user")

def Index():

    with UserContext.provide(User(name="Ren", age=20, role="admin")):
        return html("""
            <main>
                <Profile />
            </main>
        """)

def Profile():

    user = use_context(UserContext)
    return html("""
        <div class="flex flex-col gap-2">
            <p>{{ str(user.age) }}</p>
            <p>{{ user.role }}</p>
            <p>{{ user.name }}</p>
        </div>
    """)


print(Index())
```

As you can see, it is really simple! Simply ensure the parent provides the value, and the child
can get and inject the value any time!

## Built-in Contexts

Likulau provides two built-in context for ease:

- `RequestContext`: Context for current request. Available at any lifecycle, accessible via `use_request()`
- `ExceptionContext`: Context for thrown exception from a view. Available in error handlers, accessible via `use_exception()`

## App Level Context Provider

Providing app level context can be annoying, especially if another context depends on the availability of other context.
To aid this, Likulau provides a way to standardize all providers. To do so, create a file at `src/providers` and
fill in all the metadata.

```py title="src/providers/example.py"
from liku.context import Context
from likulau.providers import provider
from src.providers.another import AnotherContext

SampleContext = Context('sample')

@provider(SampleContext, deps=[AnotherContext])
def provide_sample():
    # Setup here...

    with SampleContext.provide("example data"):
        yield
    
    # Cleanup here...
```

Likulau will manage all the context and its dependencies and determine which context should be activated first.
