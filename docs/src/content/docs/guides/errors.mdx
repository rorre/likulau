title: Error Handling

import { Aside } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

Likulau provides an easy way to handle errors during execution, allowing you to simply
install a status code handler for you to manage the response.

## Error Pages

Likulau will look into your `src/errors/` directory, and find all `<statuscode>.py` file
to register as an error handler. For example, if you want to have a custom 404 page, create
a `src/errors/404.py` file with a function called `handler()`:

```py
import liku as e


def handler() -> e.HTMLElement:
    return e.div(children=e.h1(children="Not Found"))
```

During execution of the handler function, it is injected with `RequestContext` and `ExceptionContext`,
therefore you can get the request and exception object by calling `use_request()` and `use_exception()`
respectively.

## Throwing Error Pages

Sometimes, you need to let likulau know that there is an error, and you want the error handler
to fire. You can do so by throwing a starlette `HTTPException(status_code, detail=None, headers=None)` error.
To inspect the data, you can use `use_exception()` inside the error handler. For example, take a look at the
following page route handler:

```py
from starlette.exceptions import HTTPException

def page():
    raise HTTPException(400, detail="No")

```

Upon visiting the page, it will raise a HTTPException error, and the 400 error handler will run.

<Aside>
You can a class with inherit HTTPException, and it will be handled accordingly as well.

### Non-HTTPException errors

All exception that does not inherit HTTPException will be marked as an 500 Internal Server Error. However,
the 500 error handler will still run.
