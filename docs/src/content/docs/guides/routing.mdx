Unlike many of Python web frameworks out there, Likulau uses file-based routing.
This means that the path of your application will be determined based on where
you put the files.

## Pages

All of your pages resides in `src/pages` directory. All the file and directory names
dictates where the path would be executed. An exception would be `index.py`,
which will be replaced with `/` for that directory. Let's take a look at an example:

<FileTree>

- src
  - pages
    - index.py this will be /
    - example
      - index.py this will be /example
      - hello.py this will be /example/hello

</FileTree>

## Response

Inside your page files, you are required to have a function called `page()`. This function
may or may not be async, depending on your choice. This function **must** returns either a
`liku.HTMLElement` or Starlette's `Response` instance.

<Aside>

In Likulau, you are forced to import explicitly from Starlette for all Response objects.
This is different with FastAPI, where FastAPI re-exports all of Starlette's classes.

### HTML Response

This is the primary use case and why Likulau exists, the framework integrates with Liku directly.
Therefore, you are able to express your HTML in Python and have type safety right away.

```py
# src/pages/index.py
import asyncio
import liku as e

async def page():
    await asyncio.sleep(2) # Simulate heavy work
    return e.body(
        children=[
            e.h1(children="Hello world!"),
            e.p(children="I'm from Likulau!")
        ]
    )
```

You may learn more about Liku [here](https://rorre.github.io/liku/). You may also use Jinja2
templates and use Starlette's `TemplateResponse` by following [this guide](https://www.starlette.io/templates/).

### API Response

Of course, not every page will return HTML, maybe you want an endpoint for a REST API, or a simple
`fetch()` request instead of using forms. Likulau allows this by making you return
the `page()` function a Starlette `Response` object.

```py
# src/pages/api/posts.py
from starlette.responses import JSONResponse

async def page():
    posts = await fetch_posts()
    return JSONResponse(posts)

```

This will work just fine! Likulau will simply forward it right away to Starlette, and do
no magic.

## Request Object

The request object in Likulau is available as a hook. It is available by invoking the
`use_request()` function anywhere during a page request. This will return a Starlette
`Request` instance related to current request, you can find information about it
[here](https://www.starlette.io/requests/).

```py
# src/pages/greet.py
from likulau.hooks import use_request
import liku as e

async def page():
    req = use_request()
    return e.p(children=f"Hello, {request.client.host}!")
```

## Route Parameters

A routing system is incomplete without being able to take in parameters. In Likulau,
you are able to define route parameters using the `[param]` syntax in the directory or file
name.

<FileTree>

- src
  - pages
    - index.py this will be /
    - [post_id]
      - index.py this will be /[post_id]
      - [comment_id].py this will be /[post_id]/[comment_id]
      - comment.py this will be /[post_id]/comment

</FileTree>

You are then able to access the data from `request.path_params` attribute.

```py
# src/pages/[post_id]/index.py
import liku as e
from likulau.hooks import use_request

def page():
    req = use_request()
    post = fetch_post(req.path_param["post_id"])
    post_html = render_markdown(post.content)

    return e.div(
        children=[
          e.h1(children=post.title),
          # Only use safe if you're sure!
          e.div(children=post_html, safe=True)
        ]
    )

```
